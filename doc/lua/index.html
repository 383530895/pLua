<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Lua is an extension programming language designed to support general procedural programming with data description facilities. It also offers good support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. Lua is intended to be used as a powerful, light-weight scripting language for any program that needs one. Lua is implemented as a library, written in  clean  C (that is, in the common subset of ANSI C and C++). <br><br> Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program: it only works  embedded  in a host client, called the  embedding program  or simply the  host . This host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua variables, and can register C functions to be called by Lua code. Through the use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework. The Lua distribution includes a sample host program called  lua , which uses the Lua library to offer a complete, stand-alone Lua interpreter. <br><br> Lua is free software, and is provided as usual with no guarantees, as stated in its license. The implementation described in this manual is available at Lua's official web site,  www.lua.org . <br><br> Like any other reference manual, this document is dry in places. For a discussion of the decisions behind the design of Lua, see the technical papers available at Lua's web site. For a detailed introduction to programming in Lua, see Roberto's book,  Programming in Lua (Second Edition).</p>
